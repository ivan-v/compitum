"My lord! Good morning. The manor looks good today. Do you wish to review the accounts? "





----Weather----
"The rain falls on us today. This will slow down any enemies, but us too. Our land will be safe from the hellfire of our enemies... and unfortunately, we will not be able to burn them today. "
"Today is a sunny day, my lord. Excellent visibility. I say, let them fear our walls! "
"Fog covers our lands today, sire. I don't feel good about this... "
